# ICON Automation Projects

- The project is splitted in 2 parts: API and UI.
- The API project contains the solution with 3 feature files containing the three scenarios in the PDF. 
- The UI project contains two out of three scenarios. 
- Each one of them has a folder structure: FeatureFiles, StepDefinitionFiles and PageObjectModels. 
- You'll find the scenarios written in Gherkin language and the PageObjectModels containing the code behind the steps.  

# UI Automation Project

- I created an account with a password you'll see in the code. I tried manual login (on incognito more and normal mode) in Chrome and it worked as expected. When I ran the automation test, insert the credentials automatically, there was an error message that the password is not matching the username. 
- Given this encountered issue, the last step with the login and wiritng the note, couldn't be automated.
